            Attire as important, as your round will be a short hike. Shoes or boots that can handle being wet and/or 
muddy are advantageous but not necessary. Sunscreen is also important if the course is relatively open. A bag to carry your discs in is extremely helpful, as you won't need to place your discs on the ground during every shot. Its is also extremely helpful to bring a towel with you to clean and dry your discs if necessary.

            Disc color can seem unimportant, but losing a disc is easier than expected for most players. Unnatural
colors are good because they wonâ€™t blend in with the greens, browns, yellows, and natural colors of the 
course. Writing your name and phone number on your disc is also important in case you lose it. Disc golf players will 
usually contact the person written on discs they find and try to arrange a way to return it.
