                Disc golf was created in the late 1970’s, originally played with regular frisbees. As the game evolved, 
                specialized discs were created to suit the needs of different shot shapes and player needs. Now, there 
                hundreds of different types of discs that all do very different things when thrown. There are 3 main 
                ypes of discs, with many subtypes. The 3 types are drivers, midranges, and putters. The main difference 
                between the 3 is the distance which they can be thrown. Drivers being the farthest, and putters being 
                the shortest.

                If you look closely on most discs, there is a set of 4 numbers. These numbers are values that give an idea 
of how the disc will fly. These four numbers are speed, glide, turn, and fade. The first number, speed, 
can range anywhere from 1-14. This number is ultimately the measure of how far the disc will go, but it 
also must be thrown with corresponding power. The second number, glide, determines how quickly the 
disc will want to reach the ground when nearing the end of its flight. This number usually ranges from 1-
7. The third and fourth numbers represent high speed turn and low speed fade. High speed turn refers 
to the degree of which the disc will want to turn to the right when flying at high speeds. This number 
ranges from 0 to -4, -4 being a disc that will turn to the right a lot. Low speed fade refers to how the disc 
will act when nearing the end of its flight. Naturally, on a right-handed backhand throw, the disc will
fade back to the left when it loses its rotational speed. The number, ranging from 0 to 4, determines 
how quickly the disc will reach the end of its flight and start fading out to the left. A disc that has 
capabilities to do an “S curve” in the air can be advantageous to clear obstacles and get maximum 
distance.

                The flight number system can be very overwhelming and confusing, but the more you throw your discs, 
the more it will make sense. It is important to start with lower speed discs such as midranges and not 
focus so much on distance, but more so on angle control and accuracy. The angle that the disc is thrown 
affects the flight tremendously.
