        Matt Latvis
I am a sophomore advertising student interested in creating multimedia projects based on strong and insightful data-based strategy. My skills include Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, and hand drawn art. Outside of my professional life, I enjoy playing Ultimate Frisbee on the club team at Syracuse and going on long adventures wherever my friends and I decide to go. With my sophomore year starting, I hope to explore new interests, and fine tune my passions that I have had for many years.
