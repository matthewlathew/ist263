                Attire as important, as your round will be a short hike. Shoes or boots that can handle being wet and/or 
muddy are advantageous but not necessary. Sunscreen is also important if the course is relatively open.

Writing your name and phone number on your disc is important in case you lose it. Disc golf players will 
usually contact the person written on discs they find and try to arrange a way to return it.

Disc color can seem unimportant, but losing a disc is easier than expected for most players. Unnatural
colors are good because they wonâ€™t blend in with the greens, browns, yellows, and natural colors of the 
course.

                Question #1
What are the rules with an out of bounds throw?
The player gains one stroke and throws from the disc went out of bounds. If there is a designated drop 
zone, then the player throws from there and still gains a stroke.
