            Disc golf is played almost exactly like golf, except without the clubs or balls. The goal 
            is to complete each hole with the fewest throws. Every hole has a designated “par”, or a set score. The 
            par may be 3, 4, or 5 throws. Say for example on a par 3, you get it in the basket in 2 throws (Nice!). 
            Your score for that hole would be -1. If you got it in 3, your score would be 0. In 4 throws, +1, and so on.

            Each hole starts on a designated “tee area”, where your first throw will take place. Your next throw will 
            be from where your first throw landed, and from there you keep throwing the disc until it reaches the 
            target. The target can be anything from a pole to a tree, but most commonly, an elevated metal basket 
            with chain links designed to catch the disc and drop it into the basket.

                Courses vary, but most are either 9 holes or 18 holes, with a variety of 
                wooded and more open layouts. There are usually obstacles such as trees, bushes, out-of-bounds areas or even buildings that make it more 
                challenging to reach the target. Also, most courses are free to play, unlike traditional golf courses where you 
                must pay to play every time.<br>

                <strong>If it's your first time disc golfing, do some research on courses near you, and find one that is relatively open and beginner friendly. Many courses have different layouts for varying skill levels.</strong>
