        <h1> Biography of Matt Latvis</h1>
        <main><p>Last year, during the beginning of Matts freshman year at SU, he revisted his childhood love of art and drawing. He bought a sketchbook and attempted to create something in it every day. He quickly fell in love again and this sparked the creative track of education he wanted to pursue.</p>
<p>During his sophomore year at SU, he is studying advertising and animation, attempting to mend the two fields together for a rewarding and interesting career path.</p>
<p>Matt has many inspirations that drew him to the art of animation and computer art. An early one is the animated TV series <strong>Phineas and Ferb</strong>. The creativity of the boys reminded him of himself and the animation style caught his attention every time the show was turned on. Some recent inspirations of Matts include The Big Lez Show, and Midnight Gospel. Matt hopes to be able to hone in on his artistic skills and create an animated series of his own.</p>
